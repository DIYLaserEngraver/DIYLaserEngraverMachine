# Bill of Materials (BoM)

The BoM is comprised over several parts, organized into documents for easy access to avoid cluttering the document.

Miscellaneous components that don't have a category yet will be put in this document under the *Miscellanous* section.
All other categories will be put in their seperate files, these files will be listed in the Table of Contents, defined below.

> [!TIP]
> Information on parsing the BoM.
>
> The Retailers section describes the retailers used to obtain the items defined in the BoM section. The Retailers table contains 3 parts,
> which are the name of the retailer, their industry (A.K.A. What type of products they sell), and their location, which can be used to decide whether the retailer should be used or not.
>
> The BoM section describes the items to be obtained for that category. The BoM table containers 5 parts,
> which is the label of the product used in documentation, the actual product name listed on the retailer's website or in-store label, the quanity to be purchased, the retailer to be brought from
> (which will be defined in the Retailers section), and the link to the product, which will be a clickable link of the category ID of said product.
